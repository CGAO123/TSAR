```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, comment = "#>")
```

```{r setup}
library(TSAR)
library(shiny)
```

TSAR Package is wrapped within a three separate shiny application regarding, data pre-processing, data analysis, and data visualization. All application can be opened in both interactive window or browsing engine by copy pasting server address into web browser.

## Data Pre-Processing

Load data and remove blank wells by specifying a range of wells with `removerange = c()` or individual wells with `removelist = c()`. User may also use function `weed_raw()` to open Shiny application to screen all raw curves and remove by curve selection. To propagate change to data to local change, click `Copy Wells` or `Copy Selcted in Full Function Call` and directly run copied command.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data("qPCR_data1")
qPCR_data1 <- remove_raw(qPCR_data1, removerange = c("B", "H", "1", "12"))
runApp(weed_raw(qPCR_data1))
```

In the plot panel, user can interact with graph and select and un-select data by clicking on curves. User may also `View Selected` wells only and `Remove Selected`. To return to default page and current all change to data set, click `Refresh Screening`. To propagate the same changes to local data set, click `Copy Selected in Full Function Call` to copy a `remove_raw()` call containing all selected wells into clipboard. Paste the call back into console or script and run to propagate changes locally. 
p.s. It is recommended to remove large areas of blank wells before calling `weed_raw()` to boost speed of application.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/weed_raw.png")
```

Selection by grid is also possible. Click on grid to highlight wells of selection. Click again to un-highlight. Click too fast may lead to error due to speed of reaction, use `Clear All Selected` button at the top of page to reset selection. Note that clearing selections alters to-be-copied selections, but will not restore curves already removed in the graph. However, changes are not made permanently. If erroneously removed, simply close and reopen window to run again.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/weed_raw1.png")
```

Use `View Selected` and `Remove Selected` to view and remove selection. To return to viewing rest of the data, click `Refresh Screening`. To propagate the same changes to local data set, click `Copy Selected in Full Function Call` to copy a `remove_raw()` call containing all selected wells into clipboard. Paste the call back into console or script and run to propagate changes locally.
```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/weed_raw2.png")
```

## Data Analysis

Analyze data by calling function `analyze_norm()` and follow the workflow from top to bottom. Preview data table for changes occurring at each step and refer to graph to view fit of model on each well. Always refer to the message for hints and error references. A success message will also be prompted after each successful run of step.

Remember to save analysis output locally by clicking `Save File`. Always preview data before saving to ensure data contains all necessary information.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
runApp(analyze_norm(qPCR_data1))
```

The top left panel output a preview of current data set. The right panel allows user to view the fit of model and Tm estimation by individual wells of selection. Once confirming correct data input and modeling effects,

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/analyze_norm.png")
```

Click `Analyze all Wells` to propagate model and analysis onto the rest of data. A preview of analyzed data will also be modeling and analyzing all 96 Wells will take between 30 to 50 seconds. If no modeling are needed, given data are smooth enough, analysis of all 96 wells should be completed under 5 seconds. p.s. actual time length many subject to change under different conditions

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/analyze_norm1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/analyze_norm12.png")
```

Upload well information by excel template and preview to confirm if information is correct. Use `Preview` to preview uploaded information and directly edit inside the window. User may also choose `Manual Input` to put in all condition information by Well. Make sure to hit `Save Changes` after editing and click `Set Conditions` to link all data to the conditions. A success message should be prompted.
p.s. manually inputted information will override file upload. If mistakenly saved, please close window and re-run command.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/analyze_norm2.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/analyze_norm3.png")
```

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/analyze_norm4.png")
```

Lastly, to save all analysis locally, click `Save File` after previewing output. p.s. make to select `both` under `Choose dataset` if intending to use `graph_tsar()` or other graphing tools within the package.

## Data Visualization

Use function `graph_tsar()` to start a Shiny application for graphing options. Run `na.omit()` on data if error occurs. Three graphing options are allowed, boxplot of Tm, compare plots, and conditions plot.

Function takes optional data parameter. If analysis file is already imported in the environment, call function as `graph_tsar(tsar_data)`. Refer to vignette "TSAR Workflow by Command" for instructions on how to merge using function `merge_norm()`. Else, user may use the merge data panel to upload and merge data of all test trials. Simply call `graph_tsar()` and click `Upload and Merge Data` button to reveal the panel to merge data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
runApp(graph_tsar())
```

Upload is limited to 30MB in size, but not count size. After upload, user will be prompted corresponding numbers of input boxes to specify date of each experiment. Click `Save Dates`, then `Merge and Save Data`. A short preview of tsar_data will be prompted. For a full list of well_ID and conditions_ID, refer to the helper buttons at the bottom of page.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/graph_tsar_01.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/graph_tsar_02.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/graph_tsar_03.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/graph_tsar_04.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/graph_tsar5.png")
```

Top panel outputs all plots, selected desired graphing features below and click generate to output graphs. p.s. Graphing compare plots and selected curves are takes longer than boxplot, please give it few seconds to load.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/graph_tsar.png")
```

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/graph_tsar2.png")
```

Generating compare plots will output all plausible comparisons by control. To any specific one, a drop list `View Only:` will be prompted below the botton `Generate Compare Plots`. Select by condition_ID to zoom in on graphs.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/graph_tsar_31.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/graph_tsar_32.png")
```

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/graph_tsar3.png")
```

Helper functions include these following:
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/graph_tsar4.png")
```
