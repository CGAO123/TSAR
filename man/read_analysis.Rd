\usage{
read_analysis(
  path,
  type = "derivative",
  conditions = c("Protein", "Ligand"),
  manual_conditions = NA,
  manual_wells = NA,
  skip_flags = FALSE,
  manual_file = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{a character string; the path or the name of the file which the
'AnalysisResults' data are to be read from. Either a .txt or .csv file.
 The path must contain the term \emph{AnalysisResults} as the TSA software
 automatically assigns this when exporting data.}

\item{type}{either c("boltzmann", "derivative"); \code{type = "derivative")}
by default. Determines what model of
Tm estimation to load from the TSA software. Loads Tms as 'Tm B'  when
\code{type = "boltzmann")}; loads Tms as 'Tm D' when
\code{type = "derivative")}.}

\item{conditions}{A character vector of condition types assigned within the
TSA software to load.
\code{conditions = c("Protein", "Ligand")} by default.
These conditions are used to generate the IDs discussed.}

\item{manual_conditions, manual_wells}{NA by default,
enabling automated analysis.
A character vector of Condition IDs and Well IDs to manually assign
each row of the read data.}

\item{skip_flags}{logical value; \code{type = FALSE} by default.
When \code{type = TRUE}, wells that have flags reported by TSA software
are removed.}

\item{manual_file}{NA by default. User can specify .eds for merging if needed
for Well IDs if needed with a character string.}
}
\value{
A data frame of TSA analysis data.
}
\description{
Open TSA Analysis files. This function is used to load data output from
  the thermal shift software
  analysis tab. Can be either .txt or .csv file with a path / file name
  including the string "AnalysisResults" due to its automatic naming from
  the software. The values assigned to wells within the TSA software are
  automatically extracted from the loaded file; values must be assigned
  within the TSA software for the automated workflow (See IDs Section Below).
  \strong{Note:} Wells that do not have an Analysis Group assigned are
  removed.
  The TSA software automatically assigns all wells to Analysis Group 1 by
  default, and can be changed but not removed by the software.

\section{IDs}{

  The TSAR package relies on matching conditions and file names for each well
  and for each set of conditions between multiple files output by the TSA
  software. Conditions are
  assigned to individual wells within the TSA software; these assigned
  values are detected by
  \code{\link{read_analysis}} and
  \code{\link{read_raw_data}} then are converted into IDs.
  Ensure your labeling of values within the TSA software is consistent
  so that similar values can be merged - typos or varying terms will be
  treated as distinct values within TSAR unless the values
  are manually specified by the user.
  Automatically generated well IDs within a TSA file can be found using the
  \code{\link{well_IDs}} function; condition IDs can be found using the
  \code{\link{condition_IDs}} function. \cr\cr


  \strong{Condition IDs} are generated from columns in TSA output
  specified by the 'conditions' argument.
  Protein and Ligand values, the default conditions within the TSA
  software, are the values used to create these IDs. You can manually
  specify the
  condition categories from the TSA software, including user-made conditions.
  Condition IDs are used to match equivalent observations between technical
  and biological replicates. Wells with identical condition IDs, specified by
  the 'conditions' argument, will be aggregated in down-stream analysis;
  user-specified conditions must remain consistent in use and order to
  create compatible IDs between TSA files from the same experiment and
  between replicates. \cr\cr

  \strong{Well IDs} are similar to Condition IDs, as they are
  generated from columns in TSA output that are
  specified by the 'conditions' argument. Well IDs are used to match
  the analysis and raw data files for the same experiment, as both files
  contain unique, useful information for each well. In addition to the
  condition ID, the well ID includes the .eds file name saved from the
  PCR machine to match equivalent wells between files of the same experiment.
  Each well on all plates should have a unique well ID.
  If you wish to change or specify the file name used for the well ID,
  a new name can be manually assigned with the "manual_file" argument.
  \cr\cr

  The user may manually assign condition IDs using the
  'manual_conditions' argument rather than using the automatically
  generated IDs. The same is true for well IDs, which can be manually
  assigned with 'manual_wells'. This is not suggested, as there may be
  issues with matching if well/conditions are not properly matching. This
  gives the potential for errors in downstream applications as well.
