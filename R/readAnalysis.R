#' Read TSA Analysis Data
#'
#' Open TSA Analysis files. This function is used to load data output from
#'   the thermal shift software
#'   analysis tab. Can be either .txt or .csv file with a path / file name
#'   including the string "AnalysisResults" due to its automatic naming from
#'   the software. The values assigned to wells within the TSA software are
#'   automatically extracted from the loaded file; values must be assigned
#'   within the TSA software for the automated workflow (See IDs Section Below).
#'   \strong{Note:} Wells that do not have an Analysis Group assigned are
#'   removed.
#'   The TSA software automatically assigns all wells to Analysis Group 1 by
#'   default, and can be changed but not removed by the software.
#'
#' @importFrom stringr str_detect str_replace_all
#' @importFrom tidyr unite
#'
#' @param path a character string; the path or the name of the file which the
#'  'AnalysisResults' data are to be read from. Either a .txt or .csv file.
#'   The path must contain the term \emph{AnalysisResults} as the TSA software
#'   automatically assigns this when exporting data.
#' @param type either c("boltzmann", "derivative"); \code{type = "derivative")}
#'   by default. Determines what model of
#'   Tm estimation to load from the TSA software. Loads Tms as 'Tm B'  when
#'   \code{type = "boltzmann")}; loads Tms as 'Tm D' when
#'   \code{type = "derivative")}.
#' @param conditions A character vector of condition types assigned within the
#'   TSA software to load.
#'   \code{conditions = c("Protein", "Ligand")} by default.
#'   These conditions are used to generate the IDs discussed.
#' @param manual_file NA by default. User can specify .eds for merging if needed
#'   for Well IDs if needed with a character string.
#' @param manual_conditions,manual_wells NA by default,
#'   enabling automated analysis.
#'   A character vector of Condition IDs and Well IDs to manually assign
#'   each row of the read data.
#' @param skip_flags logical value; \code{type = FALSE} by default.
#'   When \code{type = TRUE}, wells that have flags reported by TSA software
#'   are removed.
#' @return A data frame of TSA analysis data.
#' @section IDs:
#'   The TSAR package relies on matching conditions and file names for each well
#'   and for each set of conditions between multiple files output by the TSA
#'   software. Conditions are
#'   assigned to individual wells within the TSA software; these assigned
#'   values are detected by
#'   \code{\link{read_analysis}} and
#'   \code{\link{read_raw_data}} then are converted into IDs.
#'   Ensure your labeling of values within the TSA software is consistent
#'   so that similar values can be merged - typos or varying terms will be
#'   treated as distinct values within TSAR unless the values
#'   are manually specified by the user.
#'   Automatically generated well IDs within a TSA file can be found using the
#'   \code{\link{well_IDs}} function; condition IDs can be found using the
#'   \code{\link{condition_IDs}} function. \cr\cr
#'
#'
#'   \strong{Condition IDs} are generated from columns in TSA output
#'   specified by the 'conditions' argument.
#'   Protein and Ligand values, the default conditions within the TSA
#'   software, are the values used to create these IDs. You can manually
#'   specify the
#'   condition categories from the TSA software, including user-made conditions.
#'   Condition IDs are used to match equivalent observations between technical
#'   and biological replicates. Wells with identical condition IDs, specified by
#'   the 'conditions' argument, will be aggregated in down-stream analysis;
#'   user-specified conditions must remain consistent in use and order to
#'   create compatible IDs between TSA files from the same experiment and
#'   between replicates. \cr\cr
#'
#'   \strong{Well IDs} are similar to Condition IDs, as they are
#'   generated from columns in TSA output that are
#'   specified by the 'conditions' argument. Well IDs are used to match
#'   the analysis and raw data files for the same experiment, as both files
#'   contain unique, useful information for each well. In addition to the
#'   condition ID, the well ID includes the .eds file name saved from the
#'   PCR machine to match equivalent wells between files of the same experiment.
#'   Each well on all plates should have a unique well ID.
#'   If you wish to change or specify the file name used for the well ID,
#'   a new name can be manually assigned with the "manual_file" argument.
#'   \cr\cr
#'
#'   The user may manually assign condition IDs using the
#'   'manual_conditions' argument rather than using the automatically
#'   generated IDs. The same is true for well IDs, which can be manually
#'   assigned with 'manual_wells'. This is not suggested, as there may be
#'   issues with matching if well/conditions are not properly matching. This
#'   gives the potential for errors in downstream applications as well.
