\title{Merge TSA Raw Data and Analysis Files}
\usage{
merge_TSA(analysis_file_path, raw_data_path, protein = NA, ligand = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_data_path, analysis_file_path}{a character string or vector of
   character strings; the path or the name of the file which the
  'RawData' or "AnalysisData'  are to be read from. Raw data and Analysis
  Data are to be loaded as a pair of results from the same experiment.
  When loading multiple files, the index/position of the pairs are
  merged where the first file specified by raw_data_path is to be merged with
  the first file specified by analysis_file_path. The same is done for the
  second, third, .. etc. \cr
   Either a .txt or .csv file; file type can vary between file pairs.

  raw_data_path path must contain the term \emph{RawData} and
  analysis_file_path must contain the term  \emph{AnalysisResults} as the
  TSA software automatically assigns this when exporting data. Data is loaded
  from the \code{\link{read_raw_data}} and \code{\link{read_analysis}}
  functions within this merge_TSA function.}

\item{protein}{can be used to select for an individual or multiple protein(s)
as a character string matching protein names assigned in the TSA software.
NA by default.}

\item{ligand}{can be used to select for an individual or multiple ligand(s)
as a character string matching ligand names assigned in the TSA software.
NA by default.}
}
\value{
A data frame of merged TSA data.
}
\description{
This function is used to load both the Raw Data and the Analysis Results
 which are returned by the TSA software. Both output files have unique
 information regarding the experiment, and these need reunited for downstream
 analysis. Automatically generated Well IDs are use to merge similar
 data within the same experiment from the different files. Both Raw Data and
 the Analysis Results files must be specified. The returned, merged results
 from this function are required for downstream analysis as the format is
 set up for the automated workflow.
}
\section{IDs}{

  The TSAR package relies on matching conditions and file names for each well
  and for each set of conditions between multiple files output by the TSA
  software. Conditions are
  assigned to individual wells within the TSA software; these assigned
  values are detected by
  \code{\link{read_analysis}} and
  \code{\link{read_raw_data}} then are converted into IDs.
  Ensure your labeling of values within the TSA software is consistent
  so that similar values can be merged - typos or varying terms will be
  treated as distinct values within TSAR unless the values
  are manually specified by the user.
  Automatically generated well IDs within a TSA file can be found using the
  \code{\link{well_IDs}} function; condition IDs can be found using the
  \code{\link{condition_IDs}} function. \cr\cr


  \strong{Condition IDs} are generated only in the
  \code{\link{read_analysis}}, see that function's documentation for
  more details. Condition IDs are assigned to raw data in the
  \code{\link{merge_TSA}} function.
   \cr\cr

  \strong{Well IDs} are similar to Condition IDs, as they are
  generated from columns in TSA output. Well IDs are used to match
  the analysis and raw data files for the same experiment, as both files
  contain unique, useful information for each well.
  The well ID includes the .eds file name saved from the
  PCR machine to match equivalent wells between files of the same experiment.
  Each well on all plates should have a unique well ID.
  If you wish to change or specify the file name used for the well ID,
  a new name can be manually assigned with the "manual_file" argument.
