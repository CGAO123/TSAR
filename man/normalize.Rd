\usage{
normalize(
  raw_data,
  fluo = -1,
  selected = c("Well.Position", "Temperature", "Fluorescence", "Normalized")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_data}{data frame; the raw data set input}

\item{fluo}{integer; the Fluorescence variable column id
(e.g. fluo = 5 when 5th column of the data frame is the Fluorescence value)
  if fluorescence variable is named exactly as "Fluorescence", fluo does not
  need to be specified. i.e. fluo is set to -1 by default,
  suggesting the variable is named "Fluorescence"}

\item{selected}{list of character strings;
variables from the original data set users intend to keep.
Variable default set to c("Well.Position", "Temperature", "Fluorescence",
"Normalized") if not otherwise specified. If data frame variables are named
differently, user needs to specify what column variables to keep}
}
\value{
cleaned up data framed with selected columns
#examples
#normalized <-normalize(data = raw_data, fluo = 5, selected =
#c("Well.Position", "Temperature", "Fluorescence", "Normalized"))
}
\description{
Normalize reads in raw data. This function normalizes data by standardized
  them according to max and min. It also reformat data types by checking
  for potential error
