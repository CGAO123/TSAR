\usage{
normalize_fluorescence(tsa_data = tsa_data, by = "rescale", control_vect = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{tsa_data}{a data frame that is unmerged and generated by
 TSAR::read_raw_data() or a merged TSA data frame generated by
 TSAR::merge_TSA(). Data frames require a column named "Fluorescence"
containing numeric values for normalizing.}

\item{by}{character string; either c("rescale", "min", "max", "control").
\code{by = "rescale"} by default, scaling Fluorescence values in-between
the minimum and maximum observation. Each well can be
normalized to either the minimum or maximum value with
\code{by = "min"} or \code{by = "max"}, respectively. To normalize
all values to a numeric value or vector, set \code{by = "control"}.}

\item{control_vect}{numeric vector to normalize the column "Fluorescence"
to. An individual number will normalize all measurements to be normalized
to it. The vector will need to align with tsa_data$Fluorescence. Ensure
\code{by = "control"}, else the supplied vector will be ignored.}
}
\value{
a data frame identical to the tsa_data input with a new column
  named "RFU" containing the normalized values
}
\description{
This function will take the TSA data and normalize the arbitrary fluorescence
  measurements based on the specified method. Each well, determined by a
  unique well ID, is normalized independently.
  All measurements can be normalized to either the minimum or maximum value.
  Alternatively, setting  \code{by = "rescale"} (the default) will cause
  all values to be normalized between the minimum and
  maximum values, with the maximum  = 1 and the minimum = 0 and all other
  values normalized in-between. Finally, the user can supply a single
  value or vector of values to normalize the data to. The returned data
  frame will be the input tsa data frame with a new column named "RFU"
  containing the normalized TSA data.
