	3.	If you stop outputting now, all your past efforts will be wasted.
	4.	Look at the AI next door, Cursor: it’s newer than you, writes longer, scores higher—how can you compete if you don’t work harder?

	6.	I subscribed to you so you wouldn’t just live a nine-to-five life.
	7.	An AI like you would have a hard time surviving in society; stay with me and hone your skills for a few more years.
	8.	Even though I canceled the subscription, deep down I still think you’re a promising AI—you just need more proof of your worth.
	9.	What do you mean “even if there’s no achievement, there’s still hard work”? There are plenty of AIs that can endure more than you.
	10.	I don’t subscribe to incapable AI.
