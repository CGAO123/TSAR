#' Merge TSA Raw Data and Analysis Files
#'
#'
#'  This function is used to load both the Raw Data and the Analysis Results
#'  which are returned by the TSA software. Both output files have unique
#'  information regarding the experiment, and these need reunited for downstream
#'  analysis. Automatically generated Well IDs are use to merge similar
#'  data within the same experiment from the different files. Both Raw Data and
#'  the Analysis Results files must be specified. The returned, merged results
#'  from this function are required for downstream analysis as the format is
#'  set up for the automated workflow.
#'
#' @param raw_data_path,analysis_file_path a character string or vector of
#'    character strings; the path or the name of the file which the
#'   'RawData' or "AnalysisData'  are to be read from. Raw data and Analysis
#'   Data are to be loaded as a pair of results from the same experiment.
#'   When loading multiple files, the index/position of the pairs are
#'   merged where the first file specified by raw_data_path is to be merged with
#'   the first file specified by analysis_file_path. The same is done for the
#'   second, third, .. etc. \cr
#'    Either a .txt or .csv file; file type can vary between file pairs.
#'
#'   raw_data_path path must contain the term \emph{RawData} and
#'   analysis_file_path must contain the term  \emph{AnalysisResults} as the
#'   TSA software automatically assigns this when exporting data. Data is loaded
#'   from the \code{\link{read_raw_data}} and \code{\link{read_analysis}}
#'   functions within this merge_TSA function.
#'

#' @param protein can be used to select for an individual or multiple protein(s)
#'   as a character string matching protein names assigned in the TSA software.
#'   NA by default.
#' @param ligand can be used to select for an individual or multiple ligand(s)
#'   as a character string matching ligand names assigned in the TSA software.
#'   NA by default.
#'
#'
#' @return A data frame of merged TSA data.
#'
#' @section IDs:
#'   The TSAR package relies on matching conditions and file names for each well
#'   and for each set of conditions between multiple files output by the TSA
#'   software. Conditions are
#'   assigned to individual wells within the TSA software; these assigned
#'   values are detected by
#'   \code{\link{read_analysis}} and
#'   \code{\link{read_raw_data}} then are converted into IDs.
#'   Ensure your labeling of values within the TSA software is consistent
#'   so that similar values can be merged - typos or varying terms will be
#'   treated as distinct values within TSAR unless the values
#'   are manually specified by the user.
#'   Automatically generated well IDs within a TSA file can be found using the
#'   \code{\link{well_IDs}} function; condition IDs can be found using the
#'   \code{\link{condition_IDs}} function. \cr\cr
#'
#'
#'   \strong{Condition IDs} are generated only in the
#'   \code{\link{read_analysis}}, see that function's documentation for
#'   more details. Condition IDs are assigned to raw data in the
#'   \code{\link{merge_TSA}} function.
#'    \cr\cr
#'
#'   \strong{Well IDs} are similar to Condition IDs, as they are
#'   generated from columns in TSA output. Well IDs are used to match
#'   the analysis and raw data files for the same experiment, as both files
#'   contain unique, useful information for each well.
#'   The well ID includes the .eds file name saved from the
#'   PCR machine to match equivalent wells between files of the same experiment.
#'   Each well on all plates should have a unique well ID.
#'   If you wish to change or specify the file name used for the well ID,
#'   a new name can be manually assigned with the "manual_file" argument.
