\usage{
gam_analysis(
  rawdata,
  keep = T,
  fit = F,
  smoothed = F,
  selections = c("Well.Position", "Temperature", "Fluorescence", "Normalized")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rawdata}{data frame; raw data frame}

\item{keep}{Boolean; set to T by default to return normalized data and
fitted data}

\item{fit}{Boolean; set to F by default, T returns access to information
of each model fit}

\item{selections}{list of characters; the variables in raw data user intends
to keep}
}
\value{
list of data frames, list of three data frame outputs,
tm estimation bby well, dataset, fit of model by well

\description{
function pipeline that combines separated functions and iterate through
each well to find the tm estimation
